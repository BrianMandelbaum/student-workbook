# In your own words, why do we use Git?
Git is a source control solution. It stores code input by the user and allows multiple users to add code in parallel. It also ensures there are no code conflicts between users.

What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Multiple users can input code on different branches, which will isolate their code from the other user. The branches can then be merged later. It is helpful when adding new features, fixing bugs, or just wanting your code separate.

What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a source control solution that is meant for individual use and GitHub is for multiple users to use in collaboration. Code is sent to GitHub and can be accessed and manipulated by multiple users. It is great for multiple users working on the same project since they can both work on the code in different locations and upload the changes they have made.
