In your own words, why do we use Git?
Git is a source control solution. It stores code input by the user and allows multiple users to add code in parallel. It also ensures there are no code conflicts between users.

What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Multiple users can input code on different branches, which will isolate their code from the other user. The branches can then be merged later. It is helpful when adding new features, fixing bugs, or just wanting your code separate.

What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a source control solution that is meant for individual use and GitHub is for multiple users to use in collaboration. Code is sent to GitHub and can be accessed and manipulated by multiple users. It is great for multiple users working on the same project since they can both work on the code in different locations and upload the changes they have made.

What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
It is a keyword added to a selector that changes the state of an element. A common example is hover, which when the user hovers over an element, the color of the element changes because of the pseudo class. Another common pseudo class is active, which will activate once a user clicks on an element.

What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit? Specificity is the system in CSS that determines which rule to apply based on the importance of the element. It is determined based on the class of the item, ID, and other selectors. It is useful because it can help you figure out why the rule isn't being applied by checking specificity.

What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?It can make debugging more difficult and cause issues because when the rule is used, it will override other style rules.

What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design? My favorite tip to improving design is using color and font weight. I have been focusing on font size mostly and reading this tip gave me a bunch of ideas of ways to emphasize text in a different way.

Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas. Some resources that I found can be helpful in the future are 24 ways, which provides web-design articles every December, and Smashing Magazine, which provides web-design ideas, news articles and tutorials.

How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone? Good design is crucial for a website. It establishes credibility for the company because if a website doesn't look well, it may lead the customer to believe the company also doesn't do business well. When the design of a website is cleaner and more professional, a customer will be more likely to do business with the company because of the positive image/experience they received from the website. 

What is the purpose of wire-framing? To make a quick design of the website you are looking to build before starting any coding. This allows you to have a visual reference of the website and makes it easier to start coding since you already have the basic layout of what you want it to look like.

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful? The different levels are low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity wireframes. Low-fidelity wireframes have less detail and are the basic structure and high-fidelity shows everything in greater detail and should look close to the final product.

Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not? Yes, I definitely believe they are well worth it. It gives you a structure of the site and makes it easier to code once you already have a layout you are looking to achieve. This makes the process much faster in the long run.
