What is Scope ? Scope means where variables are available for use

What is Hoisting ? Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var? Var is used to define a variable and is generally not used as much anymore. Define variables with let when you know that the value of the variable will change. It is best to declare variables with const and then change them to let if the value needs to be changed.

What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)? A function as a statement, which returns a primitive value. A function as an expression, which you assign a function to a variable. A function as an arrow function, which has the main purpose of giving a shorter syntax to a function expression.

What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments? Parameters are used when defining a function and arguments are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed.

What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example? It is a function that takes another function as an argument or return functions as their result. One example is isEven.

What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style. You can write it in the console tab of the Dev tools or in VS Code. Write it in VS Code to make sure the changes are saved. Writing it in the dev tools is useful when debugging.

Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML? This can be done in the elements tab. This is useful because you can make changes on this tab and see the result on the page immediately instead of having to jump back and forth from the dev tools and VS Code.

Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code? You can write debugger in VS code where you want to check for errors and this will give you a break point where you can go step by step through your code so you can locate the error.

What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code? It gives you a blueprint of what you need to do in code before you actually start coding so you have the structure of what needs to be done. This gives you an easy reference and will make the coding easier.

How do you find answers when you are stuck? I look in the resources and previous assignments/lectures first and then if I can't find what I need on there, I start searching through resources on the internet.

From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways? My biggest takeaway that will benefit me in the future is to put more planning into the project before I actually start coding. I have been jumping straight into coding and noticed I get stuck at points due to insufficient planning. 


## Day 5 Journal

Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course. I have learned a bunch of new things in Java Script over the week. I was having a lot of challenges with functions early on in the week and learned a bunch through the lectures, assignments, firesides and the tutor session I had. I am still feeling like I need work on them, but it is getting better as each day passes.
